Tally is a simple, unobtrusive, design‐led JavaScript template engine for Node and client.

**Currently in alpha and under heavy development.** You can play around with it but there is very little documentation and the API might change.

Getting started
---

Install Tally (and Tally Express):

```npm install tally-template```

Start the server to play with the examples:

```npm start```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and play with the examples.

Tally extends the excellent [Distal template engine](https://code.google.com/p/distal/) which is an implementation of the [Template Attribute Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_Attribute_Language) (TAL) concept from [Zope](http://www.zope.org).
